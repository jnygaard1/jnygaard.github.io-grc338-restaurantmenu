        <h2>About Us</h2>
        
        <p>All kids deserve the best toys to expand their minds and inspire creativity!
            Here at Whiz Kids Toys we strive to achieve exactly that.</p>
 

        <p>We first opened in 1987 with hopes of providing a special place on the Central Coast where families could go to play, explore, learn, and make memories while shopping for the highest quality toys available. Nearly 30 years later, our goals remain the same. We carry a wide variety of developmental toys for infants and toddlers, puzzles and games for grandpa and grandma, and toys and activity kits for every age in between. We have a wonderful selection of award-winning books for all ages.</p>
 

        <p>Beyond all the amazing toys at Whiz Kids, we also hold special events, classes, and contests throughout the year. Our annual Lego Contest that happens in October is one of our most popular events. We also host weekly craft and science classes for 6 – 10 year olds and story time for toddlers.</p>
 

        <p>Our highly trained staff of toy professionals is always eager to help you find something for any kind of kid. Come let us help you find a gift they will love and you will love to give.</p>
